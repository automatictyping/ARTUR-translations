You need to edit the ua.json file with the ua_corrections.json file. and the en.json is just for looking up if you don't understand the text. the keys and values in ua_corrections.json are not perfectly fit for the ua.json and en.json, becuase the version of ua_corrections is older. So you need to be careful to compare the differences.
