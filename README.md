# ARTUR-translations

You need to edit the ua.json file with the ua_corrections.json file. en.json is just a lookup for when you don't understand the text. ua_corrections.json keys and values don't match exactly with ua.json and en.json because of the earlier version of ua_corrections. So you need to compare the differences carefully.

# UPDATES
1. You don't need to update the values under "echarts" key, because I have done it.
2. For the values under the key "initialIndicators", the indicators come from echarts, but the keys and sequence don't stay as the same, e.g. the "echarts.social.1.1" and "initialIndicators.social.1.1" are not the same indicator. S,o please find the correct translations from echarts and then update them in the right position.
