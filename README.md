# ARTUR-translations

You need to edit the ua.json file with the ua_corrections.json file. en.json is just a lookup for when you don't understand the text. ua_corrections.json keys and values don't match exactly with ua.json and en.json because of the earlier version of ua_corrections. So you need to compare the differences carefully.

# UPDATES
1. You don't need to update the values under the ‘echarts’ key as I have already done that.
2. For the values under the ‘initialIndicators’ key, the indicators come from ‘echarts’ but the key and order are not the same, e.g. ‘echarts. social.1.1’ and “initialIndicators.social.1.1” are not the same indicator. So please find the correct translations from echarts and update them to the correct location.
